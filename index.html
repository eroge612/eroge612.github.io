         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University, studying Information Technology. I currently work at the Bob Jones Museum and Gallery.
	    Alongside my studies in IT, I take non-major piano lessons that focus on hymn improvisation.

            My favorite recreational activities outside of schoolwork would have to be playing the piano and basketball.
            I have played piano for around 14 years, and it is one fo my favorite things to do. I particularly enjoy playing 
            music by the group, The Piano Guys. you can see some of their music <a href = "https://thepianoguys.com/"> here </a>.
            I also enjoy both playing an watching basketball, as it is my favorite sport!
            I also really enjoy my job. I work as a museum guard at the Bob Jones Museum and Gallery. To learn more about them,
